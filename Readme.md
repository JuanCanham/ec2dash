# EC2 Dashboard

[![Validation](https://github.com/JuanCanham/ec2dash/actions/workflows/push.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JuanCanham/ec2dash/actions/workflows/push.yaml)

This will deploy a simple website (html+typescript) & api (python), to view deployed ec2 instances
Authentication is handled by Cognito
Deployment is handled by cloudformation (for more details see make file)
Integration testing is handled by behave & selenium

## Deployment

### Initial

1. Deploy the cloudformation without Certificates `make init DOMAIN=example.com`
2. Update DNS Nameservers for the domain to point to the created hostedzone (outputs Nameservers)
3. Execute the change set against the stack

### Manual Updates

Updates can be run with `make all DOMAIN=example.com` or via CI

### CI/CD

CI/CD is automatically configured using OIDC, to enable it commit back the changes in the `.github` directory
that are generated by `all`, `init` or `configure-ci`

The `DeploymentRole` role cannot deploy IAM changes by design,
these must be deployed using a Pull Requests and an admin/authorized user executing the change set.

## Operation

### User Creation

1. Browse to chosen domain, click login and sign-up via cognito
2. Login to the Cognito dashboard and confirm the user
3. Browse to chosen domain and click login

### External Users

To allow login with Google & Facebook:

1. Create a client on the provider
  ([Google](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cognito-google-social-identity-provider/),
  [Facebook](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-configuring-federation-with-social-idp.html))
2. Run `make configure-idp DOMAIN=example.com PROVIDER=(Google|Facebook) ID=1234 SECRET=Hunter1`

## Architecture

### Website

The website is built using typescript and webpack, webpack needs 2 environment variables to be present

* `DOMAIN`
* `CLIENT_ID`

It's very basic and rolled by hand without a framework.

Pros: Code is simple and can audited
Cons: It's probably grown to the point where it would be easier to just use react/similar

### API

The api is built as a single file using python3

Very basic

Doesn't handle NextToken to avoid state/gaps/expiry in pagination results

Pros: Code is simple and can audited
Cons: single file doesn't transform into testable & deployable easily on lambda

### Infrastructure

The infrastructure is built using cloudformation

### Integration Tests

Tests are written in behave and test both the API and frontend

Note that the tests requires:

* A Default VPC to exist (otherwise update `tests/steps/instance_cloudformation.yaml`)

If running manually, the privilages required can be seen under the `DeploymentRole` policies


## TODO

The following areas could be improved

* Frontend - Move to framework
  * Move packaging back to webpack
  * automatically re-direct to login page when unauthed
* API - move to proper repo structure
* Infrastructure 
  * Look into using terraform to configure IDPs
